# Local CI/CD Workflow

## Phase 5: Priority 7 Implementation - Local Development CI/CD

This document describes the local continuous integration setup for the PrivateFork project, designed to prevent test configuration regressions in a single-developer environment.

## Overview

The local CI/CD system provides automated test execution to maintain the test suite integrity achieved in phases 1-4 of the test refactoring process.

## Components

### 1. Git Pre-commit Hook

**Location**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

**Purpose**: Automatically runs the full test suite before each commit to prevent regressions from entering the git history.

**Behavior**:
- Executes `xcodebuild test -scheme PrivateFork -workspace PrivateFork.xcworkspace`
- Blocks commits if tests fail
- Provides clear success/failure feedback

**Usage**: Automatic - runs on every `git commit`

### 2. Manual Test Script

**Location**: `./test.sh`

**Purpose**: Convenient manual test execution during development.

**Features**:
- Validates correct execution directory
- Displays test plan and target information
- Provides detailed success/failure reporting
- Uses the same test command as the pre-commit hook

**Usage**: `./test.sh` from project root

## Test Execution Command

Both components use the proven test command from phases 1-4:

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme PrivateFork -workspace PrivateFork.xcworkspace
```

## Test Targets Covered

- **PrivateForkTests**: Unit tests (comprehensive test coverage)
- **PrivateForkUITests**: UI tests (meaningful XCUIApplication tests)
- **PrivateForkFeatureTests**: Package tests (converted to XCTest)

## Benefits

1. **Prevents History Pollution**: No broken commits requiring story reverts
2. **Early Detection**: Catches issues immediately during development
3. **Confidence**: Ensures commits maintain functional test suite
4. **Consistency**: Standardized test execution approach

## Development Workflow

1. **During Development**: Use `./test.sh` to manually verify tests
2. **Before Committing**: Pre-commit hook automatically runs tests
3. **If Tests Fail**: Fix issues before retry - commit will be blocked
4. **Successful Commit**: All tests pass, changes are safely committed

## Integration with Previous Phases

This CI/CD setup protects the significant improvements made in:
- **Phase 1**: Fixed critical test host configuration and bundle ID conflicts
- **Phase 2**: Standardized testing framework and cleaned configuration
- **Phase 3**: Implemented AppLauncher architecture improvements
- **Phase 4**: Replaced placeholder tests with meaningful implementations

## Maintenance

The local CI/CD system requires no ongoing maintenance - it uses the same stable test infrastructure that successfully resolved all previous test issues.

## Troubleshooting

If the pre-commit hook fails:
1. Review the test output for specific failures
2. Fix the failing tests
3. Retry the commit
4. Use `./test.sh` to manually verify fixes before committing

This system ensures that the test suite remains functional and prevents the configuration issues that required extensive refactoring in phases 1-4.
