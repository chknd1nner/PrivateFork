# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview

-   [cite_start]**Enhancement Type:** New Feature Addition (OAuth), Major Feature Modification (Replacing shell-based Git with a native library, enhancing CLI) [cite: 172]
-   [cite_start]**Scope:** This enhancement will replace the PAT-based authentication with a more secure and user-friendly OAuth 2.0 flow, introduce a robust Command-Line Interface (CLI), and integrate a native Swift library for Git operations[cite: 173].
-   [cite_start]**Integration Impact:** Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes) [cite: 174]

## Integration Approach

-   [cite_start]**Code Integration Strategy:** New services will be introduced for authentication and native Git operations[cite: 176]. [cite_start]Existing services will be modified to use these new services[cite: 177].
-   [cite_start]**Database Integration:** The `KeychainService` will be updated to store OAuth tokens instead of PATs[cite: 178].
-   [cite_start]**API Integration:** The `GitHubService` will be modified to use OAuth tokens for authentication[cite: 179].
-   [cite_start]**UI Integration:** The `MainView` and `SettingsView` will be updated to reflect the new authentication state and provide a user-friendly way to sign in and out[cite: 180].

## Compatibility Requirements

-   [cite_start]**Existing API Compatibility:** The existing GitHub API integration will be maintained, with the authentication method updated to use OAuth tokens[cite: 182].
-   [cite_start]**Database Schema Compatibility:** The `KeychainService` will be updated to store OAuth tokens, and a migration path for existing PATs will be considered[cite: 183].
-   [cite_start]**UI/UX Consistency:** The new UI elements for authentication will be consistent with the existing design language of the application[cite: 184].
-   [cite_start]**Performance Impact:** The new native Git library is expected to improve performance by avoiding the overhead of shell commands[cite: 185].
