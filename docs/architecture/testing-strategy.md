# Testing Strategy

## Integration with Existing Tests

-   [cite_start]**Existing Test Framework:** The existing `XCTest` framework will be used. [cite: 293]
-   [cite_start]**Test Organization:** New tests will be organized in the same way as existing tests. [cite: 294]
-   [cite_start]**Coverage Requirements:** The existing test coverage will be maintained or improved. [cite: 295]

## Automated Testing Infrastructure

-   **XCodeMCP Integration:** Build and test automation will be managed through XCodeMCP, providing consistent project discovery, build orchestration, simulator management, and test execution across development environments.
-   **Continuous Integration Support:** XCodeMCP enables automated testing pipelines with proper device/simulator targeting, parallel test execution, and comprehensive test result reporting for both unit and integration test suites.

## New Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests for New Components

-   [cite_start]**Framework:** `XCTest` [cite: 298]
-   [cite_start]**Location:** `PrivateForkTests/` [cite: 299]
-   [cite_start]**Coverage Target:** 80% [cite: 300]
-   [cite_start]**Integration with Existing:** New tests will be integrated into the existing test plan. [cite: 301]

### Integration Tests

-   [cite_start]**Scope:** The integration between the new `AuthService`, `NativeGitService`, and the existing `PrivateForkOrchestrator` will be tested. [cite: 303]
-   [cite_start]**Existing System Verification:** The existing integration tests will be updated to use the new authentication and Git services. [cite: 304]
-   [cite_start]**New Feature Testing:** New integration tests will be created to test the OAuth flow and native Git operations. [cite: 305]

### Regression Testing

-   [cite_start]**Existing Feature Verification:** The existing regression tests will be run to ensure that the new features do not break existing functionality. [cite: 307]
-   [cite_start]**Automated Regression Suite:** The existing automated regression suite will be updated to include tests for the new features. [cite: 308]
-   [cite_start]**Manual Testing Requirements:** The new authentication flow will be manually tested. [cite: 309]
