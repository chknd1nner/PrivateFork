# Tech Stack Alignment

## Existing Technology Stack

| Category | Current Technology | Version | Usage in Enhancement | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Language | Swift | 5.x | Continue to use for all new development. | |
| UI | SwiftUI | | The existing UI will be updated to support the new authentication flow. | |
| Git Operations | Shell commands | | Will be replaced with a native Swift library. | This is a major source of technical debt that will be addressed in this phase. |

## New Technology Additions

| Technology | Version | Purpose | Rationale | Integration Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SwiftGitX | Latest | Native Git operations | "A pure Swift, modern library that avoids the dependency and Apple Silicon compatibility issues associated with older C-based wrappers like SwiftGit2." | A new `GitService` implementation will be created to wrap the SwiftGitX library. |
| OAuthSwift | Latest | OAuth 2.0 authentication | "A robust, well-maintained library that simplifies OAuth flows, reducing implementation complexity and improving security over native solutions." | A new `AuthService` will be created to handle the OAuth flow using this library. |
| ArgumentParser | Latest | Modern CLI | To provide a more robust and user-friendly CLI experience. | The existing `main.swift` will be updated to use `ArgumentParser`. |
