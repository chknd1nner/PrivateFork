# **Introduction**

This document outlines the technical architecture for the **PrivateFork native macOS application**. It translates the requirements from the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the design goals from the UI/UX Specification into a concrete technical plan for development.

The primary goal of this architecture is to create a robust, maintainable, and high-performance application that feels completely at home on macOS, built using modern, native technologies. This document will serve as the essential guide for the developer agents implementing the application.

## **Template and Framework Selection**

Based on the explicit requirements in the PRD and UI/UX Specification, the project will be a **native macOS application built from scratch**.

- **Primary Framework**: **SwiftUI** will be used for the user interface, ensuring a modern, declarative, and native experience.  
- **Language**: **Swift** will be the sole programming language.  
- **Project Foundation**: The project will be initialized using the standard macOS App template provided by Xcode. No third-party starter templates or cross-platform frameworks will be used.

This approach guarantees the best possible performance, system integration (e.g., Keychain, Dark Mode, Accessibility), and adherence to macOS design conventions.
