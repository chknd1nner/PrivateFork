# **Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**

- Solve the personal pain point of the tedious, manual process of creating a private mirror of a public GitHub repository.  
- Reduce the cognitive load for developers, eliminating the need to remember a specific sequence of git commands.  
- Increase developer confidence by providing a reliable tool that performs the operation correctly every time.  
- Create a tool that feels like a natural and indispensable part of a developer's workflow.  
- Achieve a high successful operation rate (\>99%) with a fast average operation time (under 30 seconds).

## **Background Context**

The core problem this application solves is the cumbersome and error-prone manual workflow required to create a private mirror of a public GitHub repository. The standard GitHub "fork" is public by default, which is insufficient for developers needing privacy for experimentation or modification.

Currently, a developer must manually clone the public repo, switch to the GitHub UI to create a new empty private repo, return to the command line to reconfigure remotes, and finally push to the new private origin. This multi-step process is a frequent annoyance for solo developers and other power users, interrupting their focus and wasting valuable time. This native macOS utility aims to transform this multi-step chore into a simple, reliable, one-click action.
