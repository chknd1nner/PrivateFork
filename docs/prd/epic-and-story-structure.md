Phase 2 will be structured into three sequential epics. [cite_start]This allows us to focus on delivering value incrementally, starting with the most foundational changes and deferring the highest-risk item (the native Git library) until last[cite: 102].
-   [cite_start]Epic 2: Foundational OAuth 2.0 Integration [cite: 103]
-   [cite_start]Epic 3: CLI Modernization [cite: 104]
-   [cite_start]Epic 4: Native Git Reliability [cite: 105]
