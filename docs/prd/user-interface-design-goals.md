# **User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience should be focused on speed and simplicity. It's a utility, not a destination. The user should be able to open the app, perform the single core action, and close it with minimal friction. The entire interaction should feel like a native macOS experience, adhering to the platform's established design conventions. The application must fully support and respect the system's light and dark mode settings.

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Single-Purpose Window**: The main interface will be a single, non-resizable window focused exclusively on the "private fork" task.  
* **Modal Settings**: Settings will be accessed via a standard macOS modal sheet or a separate settings window, keeping the main interface clean.  
* **Clear Status Feedback**: The user must always know what the app is doing. A simple text label or a subtle progress indicator will provide real-time feedback during the operation.

## **Core Screens and Views**

* **Main View**: Contains the repository URL input, local folder selector, the main action button, and the status display.  
* **Settings View**: Contains fields for GitHub credentials, the validate/save button, and the clear button.

## **Accessibility: WCAG AA**

The application should meet WCAG AA standards, ensuring it is usable by people with disabilities. This includes support for keyboard navigation, VoiceOver, and sufficient color contrast.

## **Branding**

The application will have a clean, minimalist design that aligns with the standard macOS aesthetic. It will not have heavy branding. The app icon should be simple and clearly represent its function (e.g., a combination of a fork and a lock symbol).

## **Target Device and Platforms: Desktop Only**

This is a native macOS application. It does not need to be responsive for other platforms.
