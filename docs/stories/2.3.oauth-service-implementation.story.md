# Story 2.3: OAuth Service Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement the backend logic for the GitHub OAuth 2.0 device flow,
**so that** the application can obtain an access token and refresh token from GitHub.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new method is added to `GitHubService` to initiate the device flow and retrieve a user code and verification URI
2. A new method is added to `GitHubService` to poll GitHub and exchange the device code for an access token and refresh token
3. The new methods correctly handle all potential error states from the GitHub API (e.g., authorization pending, access denied, token expired)
4. The retrieved access and refresh tokens are securely passed to the updated `KeychainService` for storage
5. All new logic is covered by unit tests using mock network requests

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Refactor keychain string constants (Maintainability improvement from Story 2.2 QA)
  - [x] Extract hardcoded keychain keys in `KeychainService.swift` to enum constants
  - [x] Update service identifier constants to use enum values
  - [x] Update legacy cleanup keys to use enum values
- [x] Add OAuth 2.0 device flow methods to GitHubService (AC: 1, 2)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.2 successfully implemented OAuth credential storage in KeychainService with atomic token operations, thread-safe actor implementation, and comprehensive security measures. QA identified a maintainability improvement: extracting hardcoded keychain keys to enum constants. This minor refactor is included in this story for efficiency.

### OAuthSwift Integration
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#new-technology-additions]:
- Library: OAuthSwift (Latest version)
- Purpose: OAuth 2.0 authentication implementation
- Rationale: "A robust, well-maintained library that simplifies OAuth flows, reducing implementation complexity and improving security over native solutions"
- Integration: A new `AuthService` will be created to handle the OAuth flow using this library

### File Locations
**Service Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#new-file-organization]:
- GitHubService: `PrivateFork/Services/Implementations/GitHubService.swift` (existing, to be enhanced)
- KeychainService: `PrivateFork/Services/Implementations/KeychainService.swift` (existing, minor refactor)

**Test Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#existing-project-structure]:
- GitHubService Tests: `PrivateForkTests/Services/GitHubServiceTests.swift` (existing, to be enhanced)

### API Integration Strategy
**Authentication Method** [Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#api-integration-strategy]:
- The existing `GitHubService` will be modified to use the OAuth access token for authentication
- The `AuthService` will handle the OAuth 2.0 flow and provide the access token to the `GitHubService`
- Enhancement does not introduce new API endpoints but modifies how existing endpoints are authenticated

### AuthToken Data Model
**AuthToken Structure** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#authtoken]:
- `accessToken`: String - The OAuth access token for GitHub API authentication
- `refreshToken`: String - The OAuth refresh token for token renewal  
- `expiresIn`: Date - The expiration date of the access token
- **Integration**: Used by AuthService and KeychainService for secure token management
- **Replaces**: Existing PAT stored in KeychainService

### Component Integration
**AuthService Integration** [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#authservice]:
- Responsibility: To handle the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Integration Points: This service will be used by the `MainViewModel` to initiate the authentication process
- Key Interfaces:
  - `authenticate()`: Initiates the OAuth device flow
  - `refreshToken()`: Refreshes the OAuth access token
  - `logout()`: Clears the OAuth tokens from the `KeychainService`
- Dependencies: KeychainService (existing)
- Technology Stack: Swift, OAuthSwift

### Security Requirements
**OAuth 2.0 Security** [Source: architecture/security-integration.md#enhancement-security-requirements]:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication implementation required
- Integration with `MainViewModel` to handle the authentication flow
- New OAuth flow must be tested for security vulnerabilities
- Secure token storage and handling maintained from Story 2.2

### Technical Constraints
**API Compatibility** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-integration-rules]:
- The `GitHubService` will be updated to use OAuth tokens without breaking the existing API
- Follow existing error handling patterns (Result<T, Error> types)
- Follow existing logging patterns (no sensitive data logging)
- Maintain existing API compatibility where possible

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#integration-with-existing-tests]:
- **Framework**: XCTest framework will be used for all testing
- **Test file location**: `PrivateForkTests/` directory  
- **Test organization**: New tests will be organized in the same way as existing tests
- **Coverage requirements**: Existing test coverage will be maintained or improved
- **Integration**: Tests will be integrated into the existing test plan

**Unit Test Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests-for-new-components]:
- **Coverage Target**: 80% minimum
- **Location**: `PrivateForkTests/Services/`
- **Integration**: Tests integrated into existing test plan
- **Mock Infrastructure**: Use mock network requests for OAuth flow testing

### Coding Standards
**Code Style Compliance** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#existing-standards-compliance]:
- Follow existing code style patterns
- Adhere to existing linting rules  
- Follow existing testing patterns
- Follow existing documentation style

**Enhancement-Specific Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#enhancement-specific-standards]:
- OAuthSwift library will be used for the OAuth 2.0 flow
- SwiftLint integration: All code must pass SwiftLint validation before commit

- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect alignment with established architecture  
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Outstanding 100% test coverage with sophisticated mocking
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Critical Issues Requiring Resolution
**DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS** - These must be resolved before production:

1. **✅ RESOLVED**: GitHub client ID updated to production value `"Ov23liJgSwc0an0X22QL"` at `GitHubService.swift:13`
   - **Status**: Configured with actual GitHub OAuth app client ID from developer account

2. **✅ DEFERRED**: UI integration for device flow
   - **Status**: Deliberately deferred to Story 2.4 as planned
   - **Impact**: Backend OAuth service is complete and ready for UI integration

### Technical Improvements
3. **⚠️ MEDIUM**: Hardcoded 8-hour token expiry at `GitHubService.swift:258`
   - **Solution**: Use GitHub's actual response values instead of hardcoded duration

4. **⚠️ MEDIUM**: Missing configuration abstraction layer
   - **Solution**: Create centralized OAuth configuration management system
