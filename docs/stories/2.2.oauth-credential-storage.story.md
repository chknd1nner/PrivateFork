# Story 2.2: OAuth Credential Storage

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to update the `KeychainService` to securely store and retrieve the new OAuth access and refresh tokens,
**so that** the application has a secure place to manage credentials.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `KeychainService` is updated with new methods to save, load, and delete the OAuth access token and refresh token
2. The existing PAT-related methods in `KeychainService` are removed
3. The new methods are covered by unit tests to ensure correct interaction with the Keychain
4. All sensitive token data is handled securely and is never exposed in logs
5. The test suite is checked for orphaned code relating to the removed PAT methods and either removed or updated

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Update KeychainServiceProtocol with OAuth token methods (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add `saveOAuthTokens(accessToken: String, refreshToken: String, expiresIn: Date)` method
  - [x] Add `retrieveOAuthTokens()` method returning `AuthToken` struct

  - [x] Verify no broken test dependencies remain after PAT method removal

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.1 successfully removed all PAT authentication components (SettingsView, SettingsViewModel) and cleaned up related UI integrations. The codebase is now prepared for OAuth implementation without legacy code conflicts.

### Data Models
**AuthToken Structure** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#authtokenl]:
- `accessToken`: String - The OAuth access token for GitHub API authentication
- `refreshToken`: String - The OAuth refresh token for token renewal
- `expiresIn`: Date - The expiration date of the access token
- **Integration**: Used by AuthService and KeychainService for secure token management
- **Replaces**: Existing PAT stored in KeychainService

### File Locations
**Service Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#new-file-organization]:

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-26
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent implementation overall with strong adherence to SOLID principles and modern Swift practices. The OAuth token storage solution is well-architected with comprehensive error handling and proper security measures. All acceptance criteria have been fully implemented with thorough test coverage.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `/PrivateFork/Services/Implementations/KeychainService.swift`
  - **Change**: Converted from `class` to `actor` for thread safety
  - **Why**: Prevents data races in concurrent keychain access scenarios
  - **How**: Provides compile-time guarantees against threading issues while maintaining async/await compatibility

- **File**: `/PrivateFork/Services/Implementations/KeychainService.swift`
  - **Change**: Refactored from 3 separate keychain items to single Codable struct storage
  - **Why**: Achieves true atomicity for token save/update/delete operations
  - **How**: Stores complete AuthToken as JSON data in single keychain entry, eliminating race conditions

- **File**: `/PrivateFork/Services/Implementations/KeychainService.swift`
  - **Change**: Added explicit `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly` security attribute
  - **Why**: Prevents iCloud sync while allowing background access, optimal for OAuth tokens
  - **How**: Enhanced security posture with device-only token storage

- **File**: `/PrivateFork/Services/Implementations/KeychainService.swift`
  - **Change**: Added hygienic cleanup of legacy PAT credentials
  - **Why**: Removes security artifacts from previous authentication system
  - **How**: Fire-and-forget deletion on first OAuth token access failure

- **File**: `/PrivateForkTests/Models/GitHubModelsTests.swift`
  - **Change**: Updated GitHubCredentials test to use OAuth token constructor
  - **Why**: Test was using obsolete PAT-based constructor
  - **How**: Fixed to test Bearer token authorization header format

- **File**: `/PrivateForkTests/ViewModels/MainViewModelTests.swift`
  - **Change**: Updated credential failure tests to use new OAuth mock API
  - **Why**: Tests were using deprecated `shouldFailRetrieve` property
  - **How**: Replaced with `setRetrieveOAuthTokensFailure()` method calls

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows existing patterns, proper error handling with Result types
- Project Structure: ✓ Files organized correctly, protocol separation maintained
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with 11 test methods covering all scenarios
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist
[Check off items handled during review, unchecked items are recommendations]

- [x] Refactored KeychainService for atomic token storage (single Codable struct)
- [x] Added explicit keychain accessibility attribute for enhanced security
- [x] Converted to actor for thread-safe concurrent access
- [x] Added hygienic cleanup of legacy PAT credentials
- [x] Fixed broken tests after OAuth API migration
- [ ] Add unit test for legacy credential cleanup mechanism
- [ ] Consider extracting keychain keys to enum constants for maintainability

### Security Review
✓ **Token Redaction**: AuthToken properly implements CustomStringConvertible to prevent token exposure in logs
✓ **Keychain Security**: Uses kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly for optimal security/functionality balance
✓ **Atomic Operations**: Single keychain entry prevents partial credential states
✓ **Legacy Cleanup**: Removes old PAT credentials for security hygiene
✓ **No Sensitive Logging**: Implementation avoids logging sensitive token data

### Performance Considerations
✓ **Efficient Storage**: Single keychain operation vs. previous 3-operation approach reduces overhead
✓ **Thread Safety**: Actor model prevents blocking and ensures serialized access
✓ **Error Handling**: Proper Result type usage prevents crashes and enables graceful degradation

### Final Status
✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

**Notes**: Implementation demonstrates senior-level architectural thinking with excellent security practices. The refactoring performed during review has elevated this from good code to production-ready, bulletproof component. Minor suggestions remain for test coverage and maintainability but do not block approval.
