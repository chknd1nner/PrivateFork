# Story 1.3d: Fork Button Implementation and Design Standards

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a "Create Private Fork" button with proper macOS design standards and theme support,
**so that** I can initiate the fork operation with a polished, native macOS experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main view contains a "Create Private Fork" button.
2. The main view contains a text area or label to display real-time status updates.
3. All UI elements adhere to standard macOS design conventions and support both light and dark modes.
4. The overall interface follows macOS Human Interface Guidelines for layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement Create Private Fork button (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add "Create Private Fork" button to MainView
  - [ ] Connect button to MainViewModel method

  - [ ] Implement button action handler in MainViewModel
- [ ] Add real-time status updates area (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add text area/label for status messages in MainView
  - [ ] Add @Published statusMessage property to MainViewModel
  - [ ] Implement status message display with proper formatting
  - [ ] Add status message styling and layout
- [ ] Ensure comprehensive macOS design compliance (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Apply standard macOS spacing and sizing conventions
  - [ ] Test and verify light/dark mode compatibility for all components
  - [ ] Apply appropriate macOS button and field styling
  - [ ] Implement proper visual hierarchy and layout
  - [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance (VoiceOver, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests
  - [ ] Test button action and MainViewModel method integration
  - [ ] Test status message display and formatting
  - [ ] Test @Published property updates for status messages
  - [ ] Test UI state management for button interactions
- [ ] Integration testing with previous stories
  - [ ] Test complete user flow from URL input to fork button
  - [ ] Test button state based on URL validation and credentials
  - [ ] Test overall UI coherence and user experience

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: The project successfully implements secure credential management with KeychainService. From Story 1.3a: URL input and validation functionality is complete. From Story 1.3b: Directory selection is implemented. From Story 1.3c: Credentials integration and UI state management is ready. This story completes the main interface by adding the primary action button and status display.

### Project Structure
Following the MVVM pattern from the source tree, the fork button and status components should be organized as:
- **Views/MainView.swift**: Already exists, needs fork button and status display [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#views]
- **ViewModels/MainViewModel.swift**: Already exists, needs fork action method [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#viewmodels]

### Component Standards
MainView must follow the component template structure with:
- @StateObject for ViewModel ownership (already implemented)
- UI elements bound to @Published properties
- Actions calling ViewModel methods
- Proper layout and spacing following macOS conventions
[Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#component-template]

### Coding Standards Requirements
- **MVVM Pattern**: MainView for display only, MainViewModel contains all logic [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **@MainActor**: MainViewModel already marked with @MainActor [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Fork operation must use async/await [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Result Type**: Fork operation should return Result<Success, Error> [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: SwiftUI 5.0+ for UI components [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Swift 5.10+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Dependencies**: Native Apple frameworks only (Foundation for status handling) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### macOS Design Standards Implementation
Ensure compliance with macOS Human Interface Guidelines:
- Button styling with appropriate prominence and spacing
- Status message area with clear visual hierarchy
- Proper layout margins and padding
- Accessibility support (VoiceOver, keyboard navigation)
- Light and dark mode compatibility
- Native macOS visual elements and behaviors

### State Management Pattern
MainViewModel should include these @Published properties for fork functionality:
- @Published var statusMessage: String = "Ready."
- @Published var isForking: Bool = false
- @Published var canCreateFork: Bool = false (computed property)
[Source: docs/architecture/state-management.md#state-management-template]

### Integration with Previous Stories
This story integrates with all previous functionality:
- URL validation from Story 1.3a
- Directory selection from Story 1.3b
- Credentials checking from Story 1.3c
- The fork button should be enabled only when all prerequisites are met

### Naming Conventions
- **Views**: MainView.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **ViewModels**: MainViewModel.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- PrivateForkTests/ViewModels/MainViewModelTests.swift (already exists, needs expansion)
- PrivateForkTests/Integration/MainViewIntegrationTests.swift (new file for integration testing)
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#component-test-template]

**Test Standards:**
- All ViewModels require comprehensive unit tests following Given-When-Then structure using XCTest
- Integration testing required to verify complete user flow
- Test coverage must include button interactions and status message scenarios
- UI state management testing for all @Published properties
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#testing-best-practices]

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- Framework: XCTest (native macOS testing framework)
- Pattern: Given-When-Then structure for test organization
- Integration Testing: Test complete user workflows and component interactions
- Async Testing: Use expectation-based testing for async operations

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Button functionality: Test button action and MainViewModel method integration
- Status message display: Test various status message scenarios and formatting
- Integration testing: Test complete user flow from URL input to fork button
- UI state management: Test button enabling based on validation and credentials
- macOS compliance: Test accessibility and theme support
