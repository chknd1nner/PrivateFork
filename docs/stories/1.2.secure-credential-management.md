# Story 1.2: Secure Credential Management

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a user, I want to securely save my GitHub credentials in the app, so that I don't have to enter them every time I use the utility.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Settings view is created with fields for "GitHub Username" and "Personal Access Token".
2. The Personal Access Token input field is secured (obscured/masked using SecureField) to prevent shoulder surfing and does not expose plain text at any time.
3. A "Validate & Save" button exists on the Settings view.
4. Clicking "Validate & Save" with valid credentials (verified against GitHub API) successfully saves the username and PAT to the macOS Keychain using service identifier "com.example.PrivateFork.github".
5. Clicking "Validate & Save" with invalid credentials (non-existent username, invalid PAT format, or failed GitHub API validation) displays a clear, specific error message to the user and does not save the credentials to Keychain.
6. A "Clear" button on the Settings view removes any saved credentials from the Keychain and clears the input fields.
7. The Settings view is accessible from the main application view (e.g., via a settings button or menu item).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: Pay attention to Swift Package Framework References issue. When creating service implementations, ensure proper UUID consistency if additional frameworks are needed. However, this story should only use native macOS frameworks (Security framework for Keychain).

### Project Structure
Following the MVVM pattern from the source tree, credential management components should be organized as:
- **Views/SettingsView.swift**: SwiftUI view for credential input [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#views]
- **ViewModels/SettingsViewModel.swift**: Logic and state management [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#viewmodels]
- **Services/Protocols/KeychainServiceProtocol.swift**: Keychain abstraction [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#services]
- **Services/Implementations/KeychainService.swift**: Concrete Keychain implementation [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#services]

### Component Standards
SettingsView must follow the component template structure with:
- @StateObject for ViewModel ownership
- UI elements bound to @Published properties
- Actions calling ViewModel methods
- Disabled state based on ViewModel state
- **SecureField for PAT input**: Use SecureField instead of TextField for Personal Access Token to ensure input is masked
[Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#component-template]

### Coding Standards Requirements
- **MVVM Pattern**: SettingsView for display only, SettingsViewModel contains all logic [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming**: KeychainService abstracted behind KeychainServiceProtocol [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Dependency Injection**: Services injected into SettingsViewModel during initialization [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **@MainActor**: SettingsViewModel must be marked with @MainActor [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Credential validation must use async/await [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Result Type**: All service operations return Result<Success, Error> [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: SwiftUI 5.0+ for UI components [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Swift 5.10+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Dependencies**: Native Apple frameworks only (Security framework for Keychain) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Keychain Implementation Details
Use native macOS Security framework for Keychain operations:
- Store credentials with service identifier "com.example.PrivateFork.github"
- Username as account parameter
- Personal Access Token as password data
- Implement proper error handling for Keychain status codes

### State Management Pattern
SettingsViewModel should follow the state management template:
- @Published properties for username, token, isValidating, errorMessage, isSaved
- Dependency injection in init() with default implementations
- Public methods called by SettingsView for validate, save, clear actions
[Source: docs/architecture/state-management.md#state-management-template]

### Naming Conventions
- **Views**: SettingsView.swift [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **ViewModels**: SettingsViewModel.swift [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Service Protocols**: KeychainServiceProtocol.swift, GitHubValidationServiceProtocol.swift [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Service Implementations**: KeychainService.swift, GitHubValidationService.swift [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Testing
**Test File Locations:**
- PrivateForkTests/ViewModels/SettingsViewModelTests.swift
- PrivateForkTests/Mocks/MockKeychainService.swift
- PrivateForkTests/Mocks/MockGitHubValidationService.swift
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#component-test-template]

**Test Standards:**
- All ViewModels and Services require comprehensive unit tests following Given-When-Then structure using XCTest
- Mock all external dependencies for isolation
- Test coverage must include success and failure scenarios for credential validation
- Security testing: Ensure sensitive data is not logged or exposed in test outputs
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#testing-best-practices]

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- Framework: XCTest (native iOS testing framework)
- Pattern: Given-When-Then structure for test organization
- Mocking: Protocol-based mocking for service dependencies
- Async Testing: Use expectation-based testing for async operations

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Keychain operations: Test save, retrieve, delete, and error scenarios
- Credential validation: Test valid/invalid GitHub credentials
- UI state management: Test loading states, error messages, and success states
- Security: Verify Personal Access Token is properly masked in SecureField
- Error handling: Test all error paths and user-facing error messages
