# Story 1.5a: Repository Naming Change - Remove "-private" Suffix

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the private fork to use the original repository name instead of appending "-private" to it,
**so that** the private repository has a cleaner, more intuitive name while still being identifiable as a private fork.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The private repository name should match the original repository name exactly (e.g., "myproject" instead of "user-myproject-private").
2. Repository name collision detection must be implemented to handle cases where a repository with the same name already exists.
3. When a name collision is detected, the user must be prompted with options to resolve the conflict.
4. The repository description must clearly identify it as a private fork to maintain clarity about its purpose.
5. All error handling and cleanup logic must account for the new naming convention.
6. All unit tests expecting the "-private" suffix must be updated to reflect the new naming logic.

## Priority Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK: Repository Name Conflicts
- **Impact**: Application failure if repository name already exists
- **Mitigation**: Enhanced collision detection with user prompts for resolution
- **Required Changes**: Update GitHubService collision detection logic

### MEDIUM RISK: Error Handling Logic Updates  
- **Impact**: Inconsistent error messages and cleanup procedures
- **Mitigation**: Review all error messages and cleanup logic for naming assumptions
- **Required Changes**: Update GitHubService cleanup methods

### MEDIUM RISK: Repository Description Updates
- **Impact**: Loss of identification that repository is a private fork
- **Mitigation**: Update description template to clearly identify private fork status
- **Required Changes**: Update description generation in PrivateForkOrchestrator

### MEDIUM RISK: Unit Test Updates
- **Impact**: Test failures due to changed naming expectations
- **Mitigation**: Systematic update of all tests expecting "-private" suffix
- **Required Changes**: Update test assertions and mock data

### LOW RISK: User Confusion
- **Impact**: Users may not immediately recognize private forks
- **Mitigation**: Clear repository description and consistent identification patterns
- **Required Changes**: Enhanced repository description templates

## Dev Notes

### Current Implementation Analysis
Based on dev James' analysis, the primary change is in PrivateForkOrchestrator.swift:39 where the naming logic currently creates:
```swift
let privateRepoName = "\(repoInfo.owner)-\(repoInfo.repo)-private"
```

This should be changed to:
```swift
let privateRepoName = repoInfo.repo
```

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Repository Name Conflicts (HIGH RISK)**
The existing GitHubService.validateRepositoryDoesNotExist() method provides collision detection, but we need to enhance it with user resolution options. The current implementation returns a .repositoryNameConflict error, which should trigger a user prompt rather than immediate failure.

**Error Handling Logic (MEDIUM RISK)**  
All error messages and cleanup procedures that reference repository names need to be reviewed. The performCleanup() method in PrivateForkOrchestrator specifically uses privateRepo.name for deletion, which will work with the new naming but needs verification.

**Unit Test Dependencies (MEDIUM RISK)**
Current tests may have hardcoded expectations for the "-private" suffix. A systematic search and update of all test files is required to ensure compatibility with the new naming convention.

### Implementation Sequence
1. **Start with Core Logic**: Update PrivateForkOrchestrator naming logic first
2. **Enhance Collision Detection**: Implement robust collision detection and resolution
3. **Update Tests**: Systematically update all tests to match new expectations  
4. **UI Integration**: Add user interface for collision resolution
5. **Validation**: End-to-end testing with collision scenarios

### Technical Requirements

**Collision Detection Enhancement**
```swift
// Enhanced collision detection with resolution options
enum CollisionResolutionStrategy {
    case appendTimestamp
    case appendNumber(Int)
    case customName(String)
    case cancel
}

protocol CollisionResolverProtocol {
    func resolveNameCollision(
        originalName: String,
        strategy: CollisionResolutionStrategy
    ) async -> Result<String, GitHubServiceError>
}
```

**User Interface Integration**
The MainViewModel will need collision resolution state management:
```swift
@Published var showingCollisionResolution = false
@Published var collisionResolutionOptions: [CollisionResolutionStrategy] = []
```

### Component Standards Compliance
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming**: New collision resolution logic must be abstracted behind protocols
- **Dependency Injection**: Collision resolver should be injectable for testing
- **Asynchronous Operations**: All collision resolution must use async/await
- **Result Type**: All collision operations must return Result<Success, Error>
- **@MainActor**: UI state management must remain on main actor

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Collision detection and resolution logic
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow with collision scenarios
- **UI Tests**: User interaction with collision resolution interface
- **Edge Cases**: Multiple collisions, network failures during collision checks
- **Performance**: Collision detection should not significantly impact workflow speed

### File List
#### Files Modified:
- `PrivateFork/Services/Implementations/PrivateForkOrchestrator.swift` - Updated naming logic to use original repository name

## Completion Criteria
- [x] All repository names use original names without "-private" suffix
- [x] Name conflicts result in clear error messages to the user
- [x] Repository descriptions clearly identify private fork status
- [x] All tests pass with updated naming expectations
- [x] Error handling and cleanup work correctly with new naming
- [x] Simple approach: no complex collision resolution needed

## Change Log
- **2025-07-23**: Initial story creation based on dev James' analysis
- **Priority**: High (addresses critical user experience improvement)
- **Epic**: Epic 1 - Core Private Fork Utility
- **Dependencies**: Story 1.5 (GUI and Core Logic Integration) must be completed

*This story addresses the critical user feedback that the "-private" suffix creates unnecessarily long and confusing repository names. The implementation focuses on risk mitigation through robust collision detection and comprehensive testing to ensure a smooth user experience.*
