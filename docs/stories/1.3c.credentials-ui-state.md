# Story 1.3c: Credentials Integration and UI State Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** clear indication of my GitHub credentials status and appropriate UI state management,
**so that** I know when I need to configure credentials and when I can proceed with the fork operation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An indicator is present on the main view to show whether GitHub credentials have been saved. If not saved, a message invites the user to configure them in settings.
2. This indicator updates immediately when credentials are saved or cleared.
3. The repository URL input, folder selector button, and "Create Private Fork" button are disabled/greyed-out until valid GitHub credentials have been saved.
4. All UI elements adhere to standard macOS design conventions and support both light and dark modes.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement credentials status indicator (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Add KeychainService dependency to MainViewModel
  - [ ] Add @Published property for credentials status

  - [ ] Bind URL input disabled state to credentials availability
  - [ ] Update UI elements styling for disabled states
- [ ] Implement real-time credentials status updates (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add credentials status checking on MainViewModel initialization
  - [ ] Update credential status when returning from settings sheet
  - [ ] Implement immediate UI updates when credentials change
- [ ] Ensure macOS design compliance and theme support (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Apply standard macOS styling for disabled UI elements
  - [ ] Apply standard macOS spacing and sizing conventions
  - [ ] Test and verify light/dark mode compatibility for credentials UI
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests
  - [ ] Test credentials status checking and UI state management
  - [ ] Test UI element enabling/disabling based on credentials
  - [ ] Test real-time updates when credentials are saved/cleared
  - [ ] Test all @Published property updates and computed properties

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: The project successfully implements secure credential management with KeychainService. The MainViewModel already has settings sheet functionality. From Stories 1.3a and 1.3b: URL input and directory selection functionality is available and needs to be integrated with credentials-based state management.

### Project Structure
Following the MVVM pattern from the source tree, the credentials integration components should be organized as:
- **Views/MainView.swift**: Already exists, needs credentials indicator and state binding [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#views]
- **ViewModels/MainViewModel.swift**: Already exists, needs credentials checking logic [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#viewmodels]
- **Services/**: Will reuse existing KeychainService for credential checking [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#services]

### Component Standards
MainView must follow the component template structure with:
- @StateObject for ViewModel ownership (already implemented)
- UI elements bound to @Published properties
- Actions calling ViewModel methods
- Disabled state based on ViewModel state
[Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#component-template]

### Coding Standards Requirements
- **MVVM Pattern**: MainView for display only, MainViewModel contains all logic [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming**: Reuse existing KeychainServiceProtocol for credential checking [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Dependency Injection**: KeychainService injected into MainViewModel during initialization [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **@MainActor**: MainViewModel already marked with @MainActor [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Credential checking must use async/await [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Result Type**: All credential operations should return Result<Success, Error> [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: SwiftUI 5.0+ for UI components [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Swift 5.10+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Dependencies**: Native Apple frameworks only (Foundation for credential checking) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Credential Status Integration
Reuse existing KeychainService from Story 1.2:
- Check for saved credentials on MainViewModel initialization
- Update credential status when returning from settings sheet
- Provide clear messaging when credentials are missing
- Link to settings configuration when credentials not found

### State Management Pattern
MainViewModel should include these @Published properties for credentials functionality:
- @Published var hasCredentials: Bool = false
- @Published var credentialsStatusMessage: String = ""
- @Published var isShowingSettings: Bool = false (already exists)
- Computed properties for UI element enablement
- Dependency injection for KeychainService with default implementation
[Source: docs/architecture/state-management.md#state-management-template]

### Naming Conventions
- **Views**: MainView.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **ViewModels**: MainViewModel.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Service Protocols**: KeychainServiceProtocol.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Service Implementations**: KeychainService.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- PrivateForkTests/ViewModels/MainViewModelTests.swift (already exists, needs expansion)
- PrivateForkTests/Mocks/MockKeychainService.swift (already exists, can be reused)
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#component-test-template]

**Test Standards:**
- All ViewModels require comprehensive unit tests following Given-When-Then structure using XCTest
- Mock all external dependencies for isolation
- Test coverage must include credential checking scenarios and UI state management
- UI state management testing for all @Published properties
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#testing-best-practices]

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- Framework: XCTest (native macOS testing framework)
- Pattern: Given-When-Then structure for test organization
- Mocking: Protocol-based mocking for service dependencies
- Async Testing: Use expectation-based testing for async operations

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Credential checking: Test credential availability detection and UI state updates
- UI state management: Test all @Published property updates and computed properties
- Button state management: Test enabling/disabling based on credentials
- Real-time updates: Test immediate credential status changes
