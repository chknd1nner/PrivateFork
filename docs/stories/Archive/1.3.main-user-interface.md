# Story 1.3: Main User Interface

## Status
Superseded - Split into focused stories

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a simple and intuitive interface,
**so that** I can perform the private fork operation quickly and without confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main application view contains a text input field for the public repository URL.
2. The main view contains a button that, when clicked, opens a native file-chooser dialog to select a local directory.
3. The selected local directory path is displayed in the UI.
4. The main view contains a "Create Private Fork" button.
5. The main view contains a text area or label to display real-time status updates.
6. All UI elements adhere to standard macOS design conventions and support both light and dark modes.
7. A status message appears near the URL field in real-time, indicating if the entered text is a valid GitHub URL.
8. An indicator is present on the main view to show whether GitHub credentials have been saved. If not saved, a message invites the user to configure them in settings. This indicator updates immediately when credentials are saved or cleared.
9. The repository URL input, folder selector button, and "Create Private Fork" button are disabled/greyed-out until valid GitHub credentials have been saved.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: The project successfully implements secure credential management with KeychainService. The MainViewModel already has settings sheet functionality and can be extended for credential status checking. Pay attention to the CustomSecureField implementation pattern used in SettingsView for consistent UI patterns.

### Project Structure
Following the MVVM pattern from the source tree, the main user interface components should be organized as:
- **Views/MainView.swift**: Already exists, needs expansion with UI elements [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#views]
- **ViewModels/MainViewModel.swift**: Already exists, needs expansion with state management [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#viewmodels]
- **Models/AppModels.swift**: May need URL validation models [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#models]
- **Services/**: Will need to reuse existing KeychainService for credential checking [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#services]

### Component Standards
MainView must follow the component template structure with:
- @StateObject for ViewModel ownership (already implemented)
- UI elements bound to @Published properties
- Actions calling ViewModel methods
- Disabled state based on ViewModel state
- TextField for URL input with real-time validation feedback
- Native NSOpenPanel for directory selection
[Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#component-template]

### Coding Standards Requirements
- **MVVM Pattern**: MainView for display only, MainViewModel contains all logic [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming**: Reuse existing KeychainServiceProtocol for credential checking [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Dependency Injection**: KeychainService injected into MainViewModel during initialization [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **@MainActor**: MainViewModel already marked with @MainActor [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Credential checking and validation must use async/await [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Result Type**: All validation operations should return Result<Success, Error> [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: SwiftUI 5.0+ for UI components [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Swift 5.10+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Dependencies**: Native Apple frameworks only (AppKit for NSOpenPanel, Foundation for URL validation) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### URL Validation Implementation Details
Implement GitHub URL validation logic to check:
- Valid URL format
- GitHub domain (github.com)
- Repository path structure (user/repo)
- Real-time validation with debouncing to avoid excessive validation calls
- Clear error messages for invalid formats

### File Selection Implementation Details
Use native macOS NSOpenPanel for directory selection:
- Configure panel for directory selection only
- Set appropriate title and prompt text
- Handle user cancellation gracefully
- Store selected path in MainViewModel @Published property
- Display selected path with proper formatting

### Credential Status Integration
Reuse existing KeychainService from Story 1.2:
- Check for saved credentials on MainViewModel initialization
- Update credential status when returning from settings sheet
- Provide clear messaging when credentials are missing
- Link to settings configuration when credentials not found

### State Management Pattern
MainViewModel should follow the state management template with expanded @Published properties:
- @Published var repoURL: String = ""
- @Published var localPath: String = ""
- @Published var statusMessage: String = "Ready."
- @Published var isValidURL: Bool = false
- @Published var hasCredentials: Bool = false
- @Published var isShowingSettings: Bool = false (already exists)
- Dependency injection for KeychainService with default implementation
[Source: docs/architecture/state-management.md#state-management-template]

### Naming Conventions
- **Views**: MainView.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **ViewModels**: MainViewModel.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Service Protocols**: KeychainServiceProtocol.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Service Implementations**: KeychainService.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- PrivateForkTests/ViewModels/MainViewModelTests.swift (already exists, needs expansion)
- PrivateForkTests/Mocks/MockKeychainService.swift (already exists, can be reused)
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#component-test-template]

**Test Standards:**
- All ViewModels require comprehensive unit tests following Given-When-Then structure using XCTest
- Mock all external dependencies for isolation
- Test coverage must include URL validation scenarios, directory selection, and credential checking
- UI state management testing for all @Published properties
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#testing-best-practices]

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- Framework: XCTest (native macOS testing framework)
- Pattern: Given-When-Then structure for test organization
- Mocking: Protocol-based mocking for service dependencies
- Async Testing: Use expectation-based testing for async operations

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- URL validation: Test valid/invalid GitHub URLs, edge cases, and real-time validation
- Directory selection: Test path selection, display, and user cancellation scenarios
- Credential checking: Test credential availability detection and UI state updates
- UI state management: Test all @Published property updates and computed properties
- Button state management: Test enabling/disabling based on credentials and validation status
- Status message display: Test various status message scenarios and formatting
