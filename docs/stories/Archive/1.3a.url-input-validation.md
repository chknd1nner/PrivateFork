# Story 1.3a: URL Input and Validation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to enter a GitHub repository URL with real-time validation feedback,
**so that** I can quickly identify if I've entered a valid repository URL before proceeding.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main application view contains a text input field for the public repository URL.
2. A status message appears near the URL field in real-time, indicating if the entered text is a valid GitHub URL.
3. The URL validation logic checks for valid URL format, GitHub domain (github.com), and repository path structure (user/repo).
4. All UI elements adhere to standard macOS design conventions and support both light and dark modes.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: The project successfully implements secure credential management with KeychainService. The MainViewModel already has settings sheet functionality and can be extended. Pay attention to the CustomSecureField implementation pattern used in SettingsView for consistent UI patterns.

### Project Structure
Following the MVVM pattern from the source tree, the URL input and validation components should be organized as:
- **Views/MainView.swift**: Already exists, needs TextField addition [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#views]
- **ViewModels/MainViewModel.swift**: Already exists, needs URL validation logic [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#viewmodels]
- **Models/AppModels.swift**: May need URL validation models [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#models]

### Component Standards
MainView must follow the component template structure with:
- @StateObject for ViewModel ownership (already implemented)
- UI elements bound to @Published properties
- TextField for URL input with real-time validation feedback
[Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#component-template]

### Coding Standards Requirements
- **MVVM Pattern**: MainView for display only, MainViewModel contains all logic [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **@MainActor**: MainViewModel already marked with @MainActor [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Asynchronous Operations**: URL validation must use async/await [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Result Type**: All validation operations should return Result<Success, Error> [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: SwiftUI 5.0+ for UI components [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Swift 5.10+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Dependencies**: Native Apple frameworks only (Foundation for URL validation) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### URL Validation Implementation Details
Implement GitHub URL validation logic to check:
- Valid URL format
- GitHub domain (github.com)
- Repository path structure (user/repo)
- Real-time validation with debouncing to avoid excessive validation calls
- Clear error messages for invalid formats

### State Management Pattern
MainViewModel should include these @Published properties for URL functionality:
- @Published var repoURL: String = ""
- @Published var isValidURL: Bool = false
- @Published var urlValidationMessage: String = ""
[Source: docs/architecture/state-management.md#state-management-template]

### Naming Conventions
- **Views**: MainView.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **ViewModels**: MainViewModel.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- PrivateForkTests/ViewModels/MainViewModelTests.swift (already exists, needs expansion)
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#component-test-template]

**Test Standards:**
- All ViewModels require comprehensive unit tests following Given-When-Then structure using XCTest
- Test coverage must include URL validation scenarios with valid/invalid GitHub URLs
- Test real-time validation updates and debouncing behavior
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#testing-best-practices]

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- Framework: XCTest (native macOS testing framework)
- Pattern: Given-When-Then structure for test organization
- Async Testing: Use expectation-based testing for async operations

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- URL validation: Test valid/invalid GitHub URLs, edge cases, and real-time validation
- Debouncing: Test that validation doesn't trigger on every keystroke
- State management: Test @Published property updates for URL and validation status
- Message display: Test validation message content and formatting

**Excellent implementation** that fully meets all acceptance criteria with high-quality code. The implementation demonstrates proper MVVM architecture, comprehensive error handling, and solid testing practices. The real-time validation with debouncing is particularly well-implemented, providing a smooth user experience.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: PrivateForkTests/ViewModels/MainViewModelTests.swift
  - **Change**: Fixed line length violations by splitting long assertion lines

  - **How**: Multi-line formatting for XCTAssertEqual statements with long error messages

### Compliance Check
- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **Excellent adherence**
  - MVVM pattern properly implemented with clear separation of concerns
  - @MainActor correctly applied to MainViewModel
  - async/await used appropriately for validation operations
  - Result type used for proper error handling
  - Comprehensive unit tests with Given-When-Then structure
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **Perfect compliance**
  - Files correctly placed in Views/ and ViewModels/ directories
  - Test files properly organized in PrivateForkTests/ViewModels/

  - Edge cases thoroughly tested (empty URLs, invalid formats, etc.)
  - Debouncing behavior properly validated
  - Real-time validation updates tested
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **Complete implementation**
  - AC1: URL input field added to MainView ✓
  - AC2: Real-time validation status message ✓
  - AC3: GitHub URL validation (format, domain, repository path) ✓

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Fixed SwiftLint line length violations in test file
- [x] Verified all tests pass successfully
- [x] Confirmed build succeeds without errors
- [x] Validated proper error handling with Result types
- [x] Confirmed debouncing implementation prevents excessive validation calls
- [x] Verified comprehensive test coverage including edge cases

### Security Review
**No security concerns identified.** The implementation properly validates user input without exposing sensitive information. URL validation is performed client-side only and doesn't involve external network calls.

### Performance Considerations
**Well-optimized implementation.** The debouncing mechanism (0.3s delay) effectively prevents excessive validation calls during typing, improving performance and user experience. The async validation approach ensures the UI remains responsive.

### Architecture Assessment
**Excellent architectural design.** The implementation follows MVVM principles perfectly:
- MainView handles only UI display with proper binding
- MainViewModel contains all validation logic and state management
- URLValidationError enum provides clear, user-friendly error messages
- Proper separation of concerns maintained throughout

### Final Status
**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

This implementation demonstrates senior-level code quality with comprehensive testing, proper architectural patterns, and excellent user experience design. The story is ready to be marked as complete.
