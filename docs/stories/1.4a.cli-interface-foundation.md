# Story 1.4a: CLI Interface Foundation

## Status
Draft - Enhanced with Dual-Launch Architecture Guidance

## Story
**As a** power user,
**I want** a command-line interface foundation that can parse arguments and validate credentials,
**so that** I can begin using the private fork operation from the command line.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The application can be launched from the terminal.
2. The application accepts command-line arguments for the public repository URL and the local destination path.
3. When launched with the required arguments, the app validates arguments and credentials without showing a GUI.
4. If the CLI is launched without credentials having been configured in the Keychain, it prints a clear error message and instructs the user to launch the GUI to configure them.
5. The process exits with a non-zero status code if argument parsing or credential validation fails.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create CLI argument parsing infrastructure (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Add CLI argument parsing using Swift's ArgumentParser or native CommandLine
  - [ ] Define CLI argument structure for repo URL and local path
  - [ ] Add argument validation (URL format, path validity)
  - [ ] Add help text and usage instructions
- [ ] Implement dual-launch architecture (AC: 3) **CRITICAL**
  - [ ] Create main.swift as primary entry point (replaces @main on App)
  - [ ] Remove @main from PrivateForkApp.swift
  - [ ] Implement smart argument filtering (exclude Xcode dev arguments)
  - [ ] Add CLI mode detection with proper argument parsing
  - [ ] Create CLIController for CLI execution outside SwiftUI lifecycle
  - [ ] Ensure GUI mode calls PrivateForkApp.main() normally
- [ ] Integrate credential validation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Use existing KeychainService to check for saved credentials
  - [ ] Add CLI-specific error messages for missing credentials
  - [ ] Add user guidance to configure credentials via GUI
- [ ] Implement CLI error handling and exit codes (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Define exit code constants for different failure scenarios
  - [ ] Add proper error reporting to stderr
  - [ ] Add success reporting to stdout
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests
  - [ ] Test argument parsing with valid and invalid inputs
  - [ ] Test headless mode detection
  - [ ] Test credential validation scenarios
  - [ ] Test error handling and exit codes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: The project successfully implements secure credential management with KeychainService, which can be reused for CLI credential validation. From Stories 1.3a-d: The GUI foundation is complete with URL validation, directory selection, and credential state management that provides patterns for CLI implementation.

### CRITICAL: Dual-Launch Architecture Requirements

**⚠️ MANDATORY PATTERN**: This story requires implementing a dual-launch architecture where the same macOS app can function as both a GUI application and a CLI tool. This is a well-established pattern but requires specific technical implementation.

**Entry Point Pattern** (REQUIRED):
```swift
// main.swift (NEW FILE - replaces @main on PrivateForkApp)
import SwiftUI
import Foundation

@main
struct PrivateForkMain {
    static func main() {
        let arguments = CommandLine.arguments
        
        if shouldRunInCLIMode(arguments: arguments) {
            // CLI Mode - execute outside SwiftUI lifecycle
            Task {
                let exitCode = await CLIController.run(arguments: arguments)
                exit(exitCode)
            }
            RunLoop.main.run() // Keep alive for async operations
        } else {
            // GUI Mode - normal SwiftUI initialization
            PrivateForkApp.main()
        }
    }
    
    private static func shouldRunInCLIMode(arguments: [String]) -> Bool {
        // Filter out Xcode development arguments
        let filteredArgs = arguments.dropFirst().filter { arg in
            !arg.contains("/DerivedData/") &&
            !arg.contains("/Build/Products/") &&
            !arg.hasPrefix("-NS") &&
            !arg.hasPrefix("-ApplePersistence")
        }
        
        // CLI mode if we have actual CLI arguments
        return !filteredArgs.isEmpty
    }
}
```

**App Structure Changes** (REQUIRED):
```swift
// PrivateForkApp.swift (REMOVE @main, simplify)
struct PrivateForkApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MainView()
        }
    }
}
```

### Project Structure
Following the dual-launch pattern, CLI components should be organized as:
- **Application/main.swift**: NEW - Primary entry point with mode detection
- **Application/PrivateForkApp.swift**: Remove @main, keep as SwiftUI App struct
- **Services/Protocols/KeychainServiceProtocol.swift**: Already exists for credential validation
- **Services/Implementations/KeychainService.swift**: Already exists for credential operations
- **Controllers/CLIController.swift**: NEW - CLI execution logic outside SwiftUI
- **Models/CLIModels.swift**: NEW - CLI-specific data structures

### Component Standards
**DUAL-LAUNCH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS**:
- **Entry Point**: MUST use main.swift pattern, not CLI detection in SwiftUI App init
- **Separation**: CLI code MUST execute outside SwiftUI lifecycle to avoid conflicts
- **Exit Strategy**: Use exit() calls ONLY in CLI mode, outside App initialization
- **Argument Detection**: MUST filter Xcode development arguments vs production CLI args
- **Service Reuse**: Leverage existing KeychainService, GitHubValidationService

CLI components must follow the service pattern with protocols:
- CLI execution should be wrapped in CLIController following async/await pattern
- Services must be injected into CLI controllers for testability
- All CLI operations must use async/await but execute synchronously for immediate response
[Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#component-template]

### Coding Standards Requirements
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP)**: Create CLIServiceProtocol for argument parsing and validation [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Dependency Injection**: CLI services must be injectable for testing [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Asynchronous Operations**: All credential validation must use async/await [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Result Type**: All CLI operations that can fail must return Result<Success, Error> [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Single Responsibility**: Separate concerns for argument parsing, validation, and credential checking [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Foundation for command-line argument parsing [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Swift 5.10+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Dependencies**: Native Apple frameworks only (Foundation, Security for Keychain) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **CLI Tools**: Consider Swift ArgumentParser if complex parsing needed, otherwise use CommandLine [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### API Integration Pattern
CLI services must follow the established service pattern:
```swift
protocol CLIServiceProtocol {
    func parseArguments(_ args: [String]) async -> Result<CLIArguments, Error>
    func validateCredentials() async -> Result<Bool, Error>
}
```
[Source: docs/architecture/api-integration.md#service-template]

### State Management for CLI
CLI mode should not use @Published properties but still follow the Result pattern:
- CLI operations return Results instead of updating UI state
- Error handling outputs to stderr, success to stdout
- No SwiftUI dependencies in CLI code paths
[Source: docs/architecture/state-management.md#state-management-template]

### File Locations and Naming
**DUAL-LAUNCH FILES** (REQUIRED):
- **Primary Entry Point**: PrivateFork/Application/main.swift (NEW)
- **SwiftUI App**: PrivateFork/Application/PrivateForkApp.swift (MODIFY - remove @main)
- **CLI Controller**: PrivateFork/Controllers/CLIController.swift (NEW)
- **CLI Models**: PrivateFork/Models/CLIModels.swift (NEW)
- **CLI Service Protocol**: PrivateFork/Services/Protocols/CLIServiceProtocol.swift (NEW)
- **CLI Service Implementation**: PrivateFork/Services/Implementations/CLIService.swift (NEW)
[Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Integration with Existing Services
This story builds on existing KeychainService:
- Reuse KeychainServiceProtocol for credential validation
- Follow the same dependency injection pattern established in MainViewModel
- Use the same error handling patterns established in SettingsViewModel
[Source: Previous stories 1.2, 1.3c]

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- PrivateForkTests/Services/CLIServiceTests.swift (new file for CLI service testing)
- PrivateForkTests/Models/CLIArgumentsTests.swift (new file for CLI arguments testing)
- PrivateForkTests/Integration/CLIIntegrationTests.swift (new file for CLI integration testing)
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#component-test-template]

**Test Standards:**
- All CLI services require comprehensive unit tests following Given-When-Then structure using XCTest
- Mock KeychainService for credential validation testing
- Test coverage must include argument parsing, validation, and error scenarios
- CLI operations must be tested in isolation from GUI components
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#testing-best-practices]

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- Framework: XCTest (native macOS testing framework)
- Pattern: Given-When-Then structure for test organization
- Mocking: Use mock services for KeychainService dependencies
- Async Testing: Use expectation-based testing for async credential validation

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Argument parsing: Test valid/invalid URL and path inputs
- Credential validation: Test scenarios with/without saved credentials
- Error handling: Test all exit code scenarios and error messages
- Integration: Test CLI mode detection and headless operation
- Edge cases: Test malformed arguments, missing parameters, invalid paths
