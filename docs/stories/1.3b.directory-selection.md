# Story 1.3b: Directory Selection and Path Display

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to select a local directory using a native file chooser dialog,
**so that** I can specify where the private fork should be created.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main view contains a button that, when clicked, opens a native file-chooser dialog to select a local directory.
2. The selected local directory path is displayed in the UI.
3. The directory selection uses native macOS NSOpenPanel configured for directory selection only.
4. All UI elements adhere to standard macOS design conventions and support both light and dark modes.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: The project successfully implements secure credential management with KeychainService. From Story 1.3a: URL input and validation functionality is available and can be integrated with directory selection.

### Project Structure
Following the MVVM pattern from the source tree, the directory selection components should be organized as:
- **Views/MainView.swift**: Already exists, needs directory selection button [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#views]
- **ViewModels/MainViewModel.swift**: Already exists, needs directory selection logic [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#viewmodels]

### Component Standards
MainView must follow the component template structure with:
- @StateObject for ViewModel ownership (already implemented)
- UI elements bound to @Published properties
- Actions calling ViewModel methods
- Native NSOpenPanel for directory selection
[Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#component-template]

### Coding Standards Requirements
- **MVVM Pattern**: MainView for display only, MainViewModel contains all logic [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **@MainActor**: MainViewModel already marked with @MainActor [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Directory selection must use async/await [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Result Type**: Directory selection operations should return Result<Success, Error> [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: SwiftUI 5.0+ for UI components [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Swift 5.10+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Dependencies**: Native Apple frameworks only (AppKit for NSOpenPanel, Foundation for path handling) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### File Selection Implementation Details
Use native macOS NSOpenPanel for directory selection:
- Configure panel for directory selection only
- Set appropriate title and prompt text
- Handle user cancellation gracefully
- Store selected path in MainViewModel @Published property
- Display selected path with proper formatting

### State Management Pattern
MainViewModel should include these @Published properties for directory functionality:
- @Published var localPath: String = ""
- @Published var hasSelectedDirectory: Bool = false
[Source: docs/architecture/state-management.md#state-management-template]

### Naming Conventions
- **Views**: MainView.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **ViewModels**: MainViewModel.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- PrivateForkTests/ViewModels/MainViewModelTests.swift (already exists, needs expansion)
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#component-test-template]

**Test Standards:**
- All ViewModels require comprehensive unit tests following Given-When-Then structure using XCTest
- Test coverage must include directory selection scenarios and path display
- UI state management testing for directory-related @Published properties
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#testing-best-practices]

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- Framework: XCTest (native macOS testing framework)
- Pattern: Given-When-Then structure for test organization
- Async Testing: Use expectation-based testing for async operations

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Directory selection: Test path selection, display, and user cancellation scenarios
- NSOpenPanel configuration: Test directory-only selection and panel setup
- Path display: Test path formatting and UI updates
- State management: Test @Published property updates for directory path

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-16
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with proper MVVM architecture, comprehensive error handling, and thorough testing. The directory selection functionality is well-implemented using native macOS NSOpenPanel with proper async/await patterns and reactive UI updates.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: PrivateFork/ViewModels/MainViewModel.swift
  - **Change**: Refactored `selectDirectory()` method to separate concerns by extracting NSOpenPanel logic into private `performDirectorySelection()` method
  - **Why**: Improved testability and code organization by separating UI interaction logic from state management logic
  - **How**: The public method now focuses on state management while the private method handles NSOpenPanel configuration and execution, making the code more maintainable and easier to test

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to MVVM pattern, @MainActor usage, async/await, and Result types
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly organized according to source tree architecture
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with Given-When-Then structure, excellent coverage of all scenarios
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Refactored directory selection logic for better separation of concerns (MainViewModel.swift)
- [x] Verified comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and error scenarios
- [x] Confirmed proper macOS design conventions and light/dark mode support
- [x] Validated async/await implementation and error handling patterns
- [x] Ensured proper @Published property usage for reactive UI updates

### Security Review
No security concerns identified. The implementation properly uses sandboxed file selection with NSOpenPanel, which provides appropriate security boundaries for directory access.

### Performance Considerations
No performance issues identified. The directory selection is appropriately asynchronous and the UI remains responsive during file dialog operations.

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation exceeds expectations with excellent code quality, comprehensive testing, and proper architectural patterns. The refactoring improved code maintainability while preserving all functionality.
