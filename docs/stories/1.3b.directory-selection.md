# Story 1.3b: Directory Selection and Path Display

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to select a local directory using a native file chooser dialog,
**so that** I can specify where the private fork should be created.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main view contains a button that, when clicked, opens a native file-chooser dialog to select a local directory.
2. The selected local directory path is displayed in the UI.
3. The directory selection uses native macOS NSOpenPanel configured for directory selection only.
4. All UI elements adhere to standard macOS design conventions and support both light and dark modes.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add local directory selection functionality (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Add "Select Folder" button to MainView
  - [x] Implement native file chooser dialog using NSOpenPanel
  - [x] Configure NSOpenPanel for directory selection only
  - [x] Handle user cancellation gracefully
- [x] Implement directory path display (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add @Published property in MainViewModel for selected path
  - [x] Display selected directory path in the UI
  - [x] Add proper path formatting for display
- [x] Ensure macOS design compliance and theme support (AC: 4)
  - [x] Apply standard macOS button styling for folder selection
  - [x] Apply standard macOS spacing and sizing conventions
  - [x] Test and verify light/dark mode compatibility for directory components
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests
  - [x] Test directory selection and path storage
  - [x] Test NSOpenPanel configuration and user cancellation scenarios
  - [x] Test path display formatting and UI updates
  - [x] Test @Published property updates for directory path

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: The project successfully implements secure credential management with KeychainService. From Story 1.3a: URL input and validation functionality is available and can be integrated with directory selection.

### Project Structure
Following the MVVM pattern from the source tree, the directory selection components should be organized as:
- **Views/MainView.swift**: Already exists, needs directory selection button [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#views]
- **ViewModels/MainViewModel.swift**: Already exists, needs directory selection logic [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#viewmodels]

### Component Standards
MainView must follow the component template structure with:
- @StateObject for ViewModel ownership (already implemented)
- UI elements bound to @Published properties
- Actions calling ViewModel methods
- Native NSOpenPanel for directory selection
[Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#component-template]

### Coding Standards Requirements
- **MVVM Pattern**: MainView for display only, MainViewModel contains all logic [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **@MainActor**: MainViewModel already marked with @MainActor [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Directory selection must use async/await [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Result Type**: Directory selection operations should return Result<Success, Error> [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: SwiftUI 5.0+ for UI components [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Swift 5.10+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Dependencies**: Native Apple frameworks only (AppKit for NSOpenPanel, Foundation for path handling) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### File Selection Implementation Details
Use native macOS NSOpenPanel for directory selection:
- Configure panel for directory selection only
- Set appropriate title and prompt text
- Handle user cancellation gracefully
- Store selected path in MainViewModel @Published property
- Display selected path with proper formatting

### State Management Pattern
MainViewModel should include these @Published properties for directory functionality:
- @Published var localPath: String = ""
- @Published var hasSelectedDirectory: Bool = false
[Source: docs/architecture/state-management.md#state-management-template]

### Naming Conventions
- **Views**: MainView.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **ViewModels**: MainViewModel.swift (already exists) [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- PrivateForkTests/ViewModels/MainViewModelTests.swift (already exists, needs expansion)
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#component-test-template]

**Test Standards:**
- All ViewModels require comprehensive unit tests following Given-When-Then structure using XCTest
- Test coverage must include directory selection scenarios and path display
- UI state management testing for directory-related @Published properties
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md#testing-best-practices]

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- Framework: XCTest (native macOS testing framework)
- Pattern: Given-When-Then structure for test organization
- Async Testing: Use expectation-based testing for async operations

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Directory selection: Test path selection, display, and user cancellation scenarios
- NSOpenPanel configuration: Test directory-only selection and panel setup
- Path display: Test path formatting and UI updates
- State management: Test @Published property updates for directory path
