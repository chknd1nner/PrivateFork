# Story 2.1: PAT Authentication Removal

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to remove the SettingsView, SettingsViewModel, and all related PAT authentication logic,
**so that** the codebase is prepared for the new OAuth implementation without any legacy code.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `SettingsView.swift` and `SettingsViewModel.swift` files are deleted from the project
2. All tests related to the `SettingsView` and `SettingsViewModel` are removed
3. The application compiles successfully after the removal of these components
4. The button on the `MainView` that previously opened the settings sheet is removed

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Identify and remove SettingsView components (AC: 1)
  - [x] Delete `SettingsView.swift` file from Views folder
  - [x] Delete `SettingsViewModel.swift` file from ViewModels folder
- [x] Remove related test files (AC: 2)
  - [x] Delete tests for `SettingsView` from test suite
  - [x] Delete tests for `SettingsViewModel` from test suite
- [x] Update MainView to remove settings integration (AC: 4)
  - [x] Remove settings button from MainView interface
  - [x] Remove settings sheet presentation logic
  - [x] Remove any references to SettingsView/SettingsViewModel
- [x] Verify compilation and functionality (AC: 3)
  - [x] Build project to ensure no compilation errors
  - [x] Run existing tests to ensure no test failures
  - [x] Verify MainView still functions without settings components

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#integration-with-existing-tests]:
- **Framework**: XCTest framework will be used for all testing
- **Test file location**: `PrivateForkTests/` directory
- **Test organization**: New tests will be organized in the same way as existing tests
- **Coverage requirements**: Existing test coverage will be maintained or improved
- **Integration**: Tests will be integrated into the existing test plan
