# Story 2.1: PAT Authentication Removal

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to remove the SettingsView, SettingsViewModel, and all related PAT authentication logic,
**so that** the codebase is prepared for the new OAuth implementation without any legacy code.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `SettingsView.swift` and `SettingsViewModel.swift` files are deleted from the project
2. All tests related to the `SettingsView` and `SettingsViewModel` are removed
3. The application compiles successfully after the removal of these components
4. The button on the `MainView` that previously opened the settings sheet is removed

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Identify and remove SettingsView components (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Delete `SettingsView.swift` file from Views folder
  - [ ] Delete `SettingsViewModel.swift` file from ViewModels folder
- [ ] Remove related test files (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Delete tests for `SettingsView` from test suite
  - [ ] Delete tests for `SettingsViewModel` from test suite
- [ ] Update MainView to remove settings integration (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Remove settings button from MainView interface
  - [ ] Remove settings sheet presentation logic
  - [ ] Remove any references to SettingsView/SettingsViewModel
- [ ] Verify compilation and functionality (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Build project to ensure no compilation errors
  - [ ] Run existing tests to ensure no test failures
  - [ ] Verify MainView still functions without settings components
